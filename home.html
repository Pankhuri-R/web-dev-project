                Ramaiah Institute of Technology (RIT), formerly known as M.S. Ramaiah Institute of Technology (MSRIT), is an autonomous private engineering
                 college located in Bangalore in the Indian state of Karnataka. Established in 1962, the college is affiliated to the Visvesvaraya Technological 
                 University headquartered at Belgaum, Karnataka, India. Since August 2007, RIT has been academically autonomous for both undergraduate 
                 and postgraduate programs.While VTU still awards the degrees, the college has academic freedom in framing its own schemes of study, 
                 curricula and student evaluation. RIT offers undergraduate and graduate courses of study and research including Bachelor of Engineering, 
                 Bachelor of Architecture, Master of Technology, Master of Business Administration and offers programs leading to award of PhD in various disciplines.
                RIT is also a research centre in 12 areas including engineering and management disciplines. RIT is the only engineering college in Bangalore that
                is autonomous for both undergraduate and postgraduate programs.
